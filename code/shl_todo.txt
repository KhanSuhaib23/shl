shl_audio
    Not Refactored yet
    Only Windows
    Only x64 and maybe x86

shl_buffer
    Refactored
    Works for anything as long as you have a realloc implementation
    Not sure about 32 vs 64 bits

shl_controller
    Not refactored
    Only works on Windows
    Not tested on any any different hardware

shl_file
    Refactored
    Works for Windows (64 bits and maybe 32 bits)

shl_memory
    Not refactored
    Only works for Windows (no idea about 32 v 64 bits)
    Uses malloc, have to write my own

shl_platform
    Not refactored
    Only for Windows

shl_thread
    Refactored (maybe split up thread, semaphore and mutex)

    DONE
        -> Worked on shl_time
        -> Added few convenience functions
        -> Added comment documentation 

    TODO
        -> Testing the current functionality*
        -> Do proper documentation

    FUTURE
        -> other compiler support (gcc and clang)
        -> other platform support (linux and unix)


23-06-2019

    DONE
        -> Better environment setup (the compiler used is dependent upon the console that is started)
        -> Figure out problem with compilation with gcc
        -> Worked on shl_time
        -> Added display and busy wait functions
        -> Tested the old and the new functionality

    TODO
        -> Do proper documentation
        -> Proper inlining
        -> older gcc version support (__rdtsc)
        -> older msvc support
        -> compiler and hardware fences self implemented
        -> not rdtsc supported CPU

    FUTURE
        -> clang support
        -> other OS support
